        <p>i have identified something in myself and others that seems to be a common denominator for individuals at LEAST at University in their early twenties. this would be that many seek to express / flesh out / establish / experiment with their own idea of self. it is absolutely a privilege to be able to act in such ways and if it is being done consciously, then it is still a privilege. </p>

        <p>me being me, i do not feel super strongly about outwardly expressing myself. perhaps this is not true? but i do not feel that as a core value of mine. this could spawn from security or sureness of self, or if it has nothing to do with that, then really just preference / expression. i have known people that absolutely get loads of self fulfillment and identity out of outward expression, and i am quite happy for them. this sort of perplexes me, as my parents were never the type to act out to get attention or similar matters. not to say this is the only reason people do any sort of expression, because half of the equation is likely just raw creativity. in that sense, i wish i had more creativity. </p>

        <p>this begs the question sort of, is expression what makes us human? other animals of our kingdom do not exhibit expression as we do. so expression is a downstream effect of conscienceless? i suppose so. so why is it that some care so much about it and others couldnt give a flying fuck? just differences in sample where the sample size is privilege and free time? when survival is not a worry, people have more time to turn inward, which makes them turn outward, and express themselves. however this does not cover all bases</p>

        <p>i have observed some people who still prioritize self expression or perception over serving themself or true security. this is counter-intuitive to me, but i suppose is a natural adaptation in this society (insert joker meme or whatever the fuck Idk). </p>

        <p>anyways my point here is that truly abstract individualism is probably harmful to those who partake in serious ways. I am all for expression, but if it outcasts you then what are you doing. and this opens the door to internet niches and while those can feel like home and can be super rewarding (i partake) they also are not REAL! nothing can replace real community, even if you do not align with everyone in said community. i honestly even like having people i wouldnt normally jive with in my “community”. it challenges me and begs me to further my perspective / perception. </p>

        <p>however as much as i can drone on about any of these topics, it still feels like it is just a black hole, because this is how i have grown to understand my life and the people in it. the next person has a completely different idea of what i am talking about. but WAIT! as i am typing this i have discovered the theme of this inadvertently. </p>

        <p>i was trying to also say that at a high level, we all are still just human, and that it only hurts us to dig deeper into niches or interests to feel “cooler” or whatever by social medias definition. id say dont participate, i dont. but most experiences have been felt by someone else, and most people actually arent that unique. i probably have a few “twins” in the US alone that i will never meet. so, all of this to say that self expression is important, but being overtly individualistic is likely a greater harm than it is a benefit. and maybe people realize this? or maybe they dont? some people literally dont have an internal monologue and i cant understand how someone like that thinks. it interests me greatly but what the hell. this proves the point that every one persons individual life experience is so DIFFERENT but at the same time probably so similar to someone else’s. someone without a IM would probably relate to other humans based on feeling vs logic ? which is so cool. I love being alive.</p>

        <p>the sort of moral to this whole post is just to be yourself, but within moderation. we are all human, and no one person is better than the next. i implore young people to interact with as many people as possible, no matter how different or weird they may seem. the older i get, the more i realize that my thoughts/perceptions of people previously were just imposed by how i was raised or what i knew. thankfully, i dont feel like i obtained a huge moral split or something radical, as my parents are pretty tame in a lot of departments. hell yeah. some kids have to UNLEARN racism or some other bullshit. I sort of had to establish what i believe for myself which has been cool but also confusing? meeting people who’s parents imposed so much on them is like WHAT! that makes no sense to me! but hey that is life. or whatever. </p>

        <p>basically, fuck the hive mind, fuck doing what others do, following is okay, but lead where you can, and confide in those who are the same as you JUST AS equally as those who are vastly different from you. i am of the opinion that the more EXP you can get out of life (having different friends / experiences / so on) then the better person you probably turn out to be. via nuance and just roundedness. it is probably hard being friends with someone who has never left their hometown and only knows that domain. come on, we need to see more things than what is right in front of us! alas…. </p>
