        <p>A multitude of factors contribute to who someone will be, and everyone is essentially a test subject for the environment. Aside from primal instincts, individual human behavior comes from personal experience and learned behaviors. As people age, they gain skills through life experiences that shape their future decisions, allowing the mind to be an everchanging aspect of this world. Things such as gender, religion, race, culture, socioeconomic status, family, geography, hobbies, and genes all play a part in who someone can and will be. In addition to this, luck and randomness also play a larger part than some may think. Failure and learning from one’s mistakes are also key to growing. Someone that receives no exposure to the outside world or has limited resources will also seem different than the rest of the general population for an area. An interesting thing to note is that some factors are chosen, and some are not.</p>
        <p>An example of a factor one cannot choose would be their parents. Whom someone’s parents play a huge role in whom they will become as a person, as they are the people that teach an individual the basis of everything they first learn. A person is essentially a biological mashup of their parents and will behave in similar ways to them both consciously and subconsciously throughout their life. Things like IQ are genetic as well, which will decide in a way the types of intelligent decisions someone will make later. The main difference between an individual’s parents and factors such as what they like to do or preferences is that you cannot choose who your parents are, but you can decide what you like and are interested in.</p>
        <p>When it comes to factors that someone can choose, (but are likely influenced by other life experiences) things such as hobbies, general preferences, clothes that they wear, and many other aspects are at hand. Past experiences as well and a bit of randomness likely contribute the most to the active decisions that people make day in and day out. Our lives are filled with choices and the choices that one decides to make trigger a domino effect of future decisions that will eventually happen. If one chooses to not get up for the first day of a new job it could potentially cause them to miss out on an interaction that opens the door for an entirely different set of events that would dictate the future pillars of their life. Choosing to act on an opportunity makes all the difference when thinking about the future.</p>
        <p>The last main aspect that determines who someone is today would be randomness, luck, accidents, and failure. Some of the best realizations people have, happen by accident or as a result of a random act that happened. This can go both ways, as there is always good and bad luck. The simple act of leaving your house 5 minutes later in the morning could make the difference between being in a life-threatening car crash and ultimately dying. Everything in life is a risk of varying degrees and sometimes a random variable that a person cannot control is the best for falling into or getting out of a situation.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, no one human is simple enough by nature to be completely described by a set of factors. But if it must be broken down, then there are chosen factors, non-chosen factors, and completely random factors that all contribute to any given person's experiences and present/future choices. Positive interactions with other people open doors and can shape who you are as an individual.</p>
