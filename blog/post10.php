        <p>To answer the first part of this question, we get our moral values from a few different main sources. The first and most prominent would be from our parents. The second would be from one’s culture/environment and the third would be a personal experience. Some other sources that could affect morality but less so would be one’s friends or occupation. Focusing on your parents/family as the root of your morals, we know that someone essentially gets every bit of knowledge about this world from their parents. Babies do not know how to be mean or nice, or on the extreme side, sexist, racist, and evil. Either morals are directly taught or are just picked up on from a parent. For example, my mother would teach me to always be thankful and show that I am grateful if someone else makes dinner for me or has me into their home. Someone that did not have this would likely not know to do such a thing or wouldn’t think to if society hadn’t conditioned this as normal behavior.</p>
        <p>This leads me to the second way we get our morals, environment, and culture/society. While many things are taught to us by our parents or siblings, such as manners, language, and ideas, many more things are so because of the places we live and the way that those around us interact with them. The environment in the suburbs in America and interactions with other people is incredibly different than that of a country somewhere in Asia or Africa with much fewer resources per capita. For this reason, morals will be different from parents to children and from the environment to children because the conditions are much harsher. Morality is much less of a factor when people struggle for the necessities of life that people in much wealthier countries take for granted. Morals still exist in dire conditions, but what is learned from the environment will be much harsher outside of the United States than in the suburbs.</p>
        <p>The third place to get morals would be through experience, which ties in with the environment. The environment dictates experience which also changes morals. Someone who witnessed a murder or faced tremendous hardship will likely have some moral changes after the fact as experiences like those are quite profound.</p>
        <p>As for how we know how our morals are correct is a subjective debate. While I would argue that many humans across different cultures share some common morals regarding family, death, murder, and food, all morals are still man-made and are ultimately subjective. There is no true objective “right” or “wrong” because the answer will change depending on the viewpoint. Even if 99% of the people in a society agree about something, there is likely still someone somewhere who believes differently for their reasons, meaning that no moral can be 100% and absolute. As for our own beliefs, they can be validated by those around us or our interactions using our beliefs in the real world. A racist belief will likely be invalidated if he goes out and practices in public, whereas someone’s morals of just being a kind person and talking to others would likely fare well in this scenario. This is also only so because of how our society is set up. If this same scenario existed in a racist world, then those morals would be correct. This ultimately proves that morals are still subjective to society and just what group of people is looking at for that certain topic.</p>
