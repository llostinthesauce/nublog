        <p>people find much comfort in likemindedness; that is failing to stray away from the majority or just simply not being aware that another option exists. if i am doing something likeminded i am well aware of action/reaction of my decisions and it is a conscious choice. I do not think the same can be said for many.</p>
        <p>i suppose many people just have some framework or just feel comfortable in doing what has been done or like career paths / events / social groups. Without thought whatever you know will feel normal and i’m afraid many don’t bother to look outside a little. Like specifically nursing culture or drinking culture at college. Sports fans, people who go to the same type of concerts. I think many don’t know why they do things and that horrifies me… then when they think about it they just say oh because its normal!!! then go on their way.</p>
