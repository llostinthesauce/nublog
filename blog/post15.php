        <p>started this school of thought in fall 2022 and polished by this date... </p>
        <p>
            7–8 hours of sleep per night<br>
            - Avoid phone / stimuli before bed
            </p>

            <p>
            Try to eat in an 8–10 hour window (digestion++) and drink 3 liters of water MINIMUM (all times of day)<br>
            - Eat to maintain, roundly, never after waking or before bed (60 mins)<br>
            - Avoid processed foods<br>
            - Avoid nicotine, alcohol, marijuana (+ else)
            </p>

            <p>
            Stretch after waking and before bed<br>
            - Simple stretches, less than 5 mins<br>
            - Stand when possible (sedentary lifestyle kills)
            </p>

            <p>
            5–10+ minutes of sun within 1 hour of waking<br>
            - Avoid bright lights before bed<br>
            - 16 hours later, melatonin releases (timer)<br>
            - Cortisol boost + 24-hour clock starts<br>
            - Quick walk after waking, for 10–15 mins
            </p>

            <p>
            Delay caffeine by 60–90 minutes from waking<br>
            - Gives adenosine time to clear, no PM crash<br>
            - Avoid after 5 PM
            </p>

            <p>
            30 minutes of cardio / exercise MINIMUM<br>
            - Avoid later in the day (temperature affects sleep)
            </p>

            <p>
            10 minutes of NSDR / Breathing / Meditation<br>
            - Do this if feeling tired/stressed/anxious<br>
            - Lay/sit still, mine rest, or just observe your environment and be as present as possible
            </p>

            <p>
            Read / journal / use your mind in some way<br>
            - Reflect/summarize in a journal entry, on paper<br>
            - Read when possible; keep personal and school reading separate activities<br>
            - Other ideas: video games, new hobbies, new music, cooking, exploring the outdoors, talking to strangers, and having harder conversations—anything that requires thought
            </p>
