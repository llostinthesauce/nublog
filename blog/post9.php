        <p>A benevolent God simply would not allow suffering in the world. I would argue that if one truly existed, suffering would not exist either and only joy would be felt by all things. The other problem with suffering is that it is essential to society evolving. Traits die off and fall out of favor and inevitably “suffer.” Under my beliefs, it is not possible. But under the assumption that a benevolent God does exist, we have a couple of possible outcomes.</p>
        <p>First, if a benevolent God does exist, then he must not be capable of doing anything regarding suffering or creating it so that it is crucial to our survival. This is backward, as suffering should not exist in the first place under these conditions. The other possibility for the existence of suffering under the rule of a benevolent god would be that the benevolent god (good) has an equal and opposite good (bad) that controls aspects like suffering and peril.</p>
        <p>Going into the details of the first possibility, being that benevolence and suffering coexist for some reason. If the benevolent god created suffering (or didn’t and happens to rule below it) it must exist for some reason. Either God doesn’t do anything about it or can’t because it must happen for the world to be the way it is. By the laws of physics, not everyone can be a winner, and things must oppose each other or balance each other out. Since this is true, good things must happen and so do bad things. Unfortunately, the unsettling nature of some of human’s best inventions or discoveries is the result of suffering. Think of the technology that resulted from war and conquest. Without suffering, these things may have never existed or even could have. Suffering also exists in “natural” scenarios, such as evolution, the cycle of life, and the food chain. With all of this, suffering must be consistent with the observable aspects of our world and can work under the existence of a benevolent god (because it is necessary for our world.)</p>
        <p>Moving on to the second possibility, (which I believe is the more feasible of the two) where a god that is all-knowing and well coexists with a god that is responsible for all the suffering in the world. If a benevolent god exists and takes care of all gods in the world, then everyone should be happy. As I stated earlier, good things have to happen, and a benevolent god will give some form of good to everyone and everything in the world. But, since suffering does exist, a second God must be responsible for the opposite. Good cannot last forever, so suffering will take its place and be felt by everyone as well. A proper balance of good and evil may be necessary for the proper development of society. Also, the people who deal with more suffering than blessings just got bad luck. (Or if the gods are all-knowing, then they stopped a person from becoming something evil)</p>
        <p>There is just as much evidence for the existence of one benevolent god as there is both a benevolent god and a god that controls suffering. In my opinion, both are unlikely, and suffering exists solely because it must. Humans begin their lives surrounded by pain, as their mother gives birth to them, and often die in pain or cause pain to those around them. It surrounds all of us, as does good and joy. Physics simply does not allow for the true coexistence of benevolence and suffering because of evolution and the natural laws that govern the world we live in every day.</p>
