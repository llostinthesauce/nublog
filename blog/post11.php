        <p>The United States of America has a track record for creating many problems, especially during times of crisis or hardship. Every so-called positive action from the government most likely has a negative impact with consequences. Think about what happened after World War II, or the attacks on September 11th, 2001. The United States government and more importantly The Federal Reserve came at the COVID-19 pandemic with one idea in mind: Overkill. Now, the average American citizen is going to feel the consequences of their actions. The United States is accumulating debt at an unsustainable rate and needs to begin chipping away at it. In addition to this, inflation, unemployment, political disparity, lack of education, laziness, and many more societal topics were amplified by the actions of the United States Government and the COVID-19 pandemic. If nothing is done quickly, China will become the world's #1 superpower and eclipse the United States for good. To solve America's new basket of problems, a few crucial changes could be made. The Federal Reserve needs to stop printing money, the education system needs to be massively overhauled and funded, and jobs need to be brought back to United States soil to increase exports and close the debt gap.</p>
        <p>The first main problem with America in our current state would be inflation and poor allocation of government funds. First off, the Federal Reserve needs to be done with stimulus packages and halt their bailout programs that have been in effect for the last year. Those at the top of the economic playing field are being protected by these policies and are unaffected by the inflation that is happening. According to the USDebtClock, the US national debt is at an all-time high of 28 trillion dollars. This was 19 trillion at the end of 2016 and 22 trillion pre-COVID. The Federal Reserve started last week that the inflation rate for 2021 is only 2.6% (Powell). While this may be true for the basket that they observe, they are not accounting for the spending multiplier of money or how long it takes for the inflation rate to catch up with how much money was printed. CPI is an outdated measure that they can use against the true narrative. Between bailouts and stimulus checks, 30% of the total dollar supply was created by the Federal Reserve in 2020 (Robertson). It will take a few years for the public to see the full effects of this action, and the outcome is not the best for the average American. The cost of goods and services will increase because of price equilibrium and the amount of money in circulation. Wages lag this inflation and many lower-class Americans will be left behind, as 70% of Americans have less than $1,000 saved and the average income is $30,000 (BLS). When working-class Americans cannot afford rent or essentials, things will end poorly. Simply put, when the Federal Reserve stops printing money, the effects of inflation will be felt less by the aggregate economy of America. Increasing interest rates would be the next step in slowing this inevitable process, as higher rates = less inflation historically (Folger.) Examples of why interest rates need to be increased would be the housing market, the stock market, and lending. All of these areas cause a trickle-down effect on the overall supply and demand of said goods in a market. The Federal Reserve needed to lower them last year, but America's current economic state does not match the respective interest rate. The Federal Reserve wants to let the stock market run, only helping those that can invest. Buying a house with low interest rates is beneficial, but not when the entire market is at all-time highs. This needs to be raised so that the new investors from COVID can allocate their funds to safer investments like savings accounts, money markets, and CDS. The “meme stock” surge in February of this year is living proof that the stock market is broken and needs a correction badly. Demand push inflation is created by low interest rates, as bidding wars are common in this environment. The longer the Federal Reserve waits to increase rates, even a little bit, the worse the dip in the stock market will be felt and will cause an even worse disparity in economic markets across the country. Lastly, the United States Government needs to overhaul its spending. The US spends more on our national defense and military than any other country in the world, and it accounts for 20% of our total government spending any given year (USASpending). Most of this money is just to maintain bases and just operating costs. The last time I checked, a World War is not being fought and probably won't ever happen again. Also, warfare has turned into strategic presence control and drones, not bodies on a battlefield like in the previous world wars. If the US cut its defense budget and allocated even some of this money elsewhere (like education) we could cut away at our ever-growing national debt. America is a debt-backed society and probably always will be, so easing away at it now will only help in the long run. Another drastic solution to inflation inevitably trashing the dollar would be introducing a CBDC. The US government could use blockchain tech and a digital ledger system, transferring USD into a digital credit. If they introduced these technologies, cash flows between consumers would be much easier to track to make calculated decisions. Those with Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies could transfer their BTC into “Fedcoin,” as BTC would likely still hold wealth vs the degrading dollar at this stage in the fiat currency cycle. This would also prove to be a significant transfer of wealth, as many middle and lower-class individuals partake in crypto as well. A visualizer for BTC vs USD shows the growing strength of digital currencies vs traditional financial systems. The Federal Reserve has many levers they can pull to control America's future, and, unfortunately, a small council of “experts” on monetary policy will dictate the outcome for all. In summation, raising interest rates, reducing transfer payments, and cutting military spending would be excellent ways at starting America back on the right path for a post-pandemic future where our dollars are still worth something and debt is not accumulating as quickly.</p>
        <p>The second main problem with America in 2021 is how our education system has failed to innovate itself. The public education system in the United States of America has not innovated since the mid 19th century and does the bare minimum in regards to creating skilled workers. Most kids at public schools in 2021 are spoon-fed watered down material that does not round them as an individual in any way at all. Unless a child is placed in advanced level classes, no critical thinking is being performed and there are no true consequences for performing badly. In the Lee's Summit School District, four years of Algebra is a standard, but only 1 semester of personal finance. To me, this paints a clear picture as to why America is debt-ridden and saves so little. According to a Statasia article by Vultaggio, 70% of Americans have less than $1,000 saved. This is astounding, as the average income is $30,000 and most people making the average are probably spending a majority of their income on housing and groceries (United States Census Bureau). Tying back to education, no one is taught about savings vehicles or investing. Most people do not know what a 401k is or how it works, even though it is a very simple concept. Only about 66% of people that can take advantage of an employer match 401k does. If we required a standard of classes that went over saving, investing, taxes, and financial freedom, Americans would reap the benefits of saving and moving toward a life of being debt-free. Many see their parents or those in their communities live way beyond their means because the ebb and flow of society promotes it and creates poor financial decisions that have lasting effects on individuals and national debt as well. If we taught kids to just save at the bare minimum, the benefits would be unbelievable. Safer investments like CDS, bonds, and ETFs could also be taken advantage of if interest rates were increased slightly. Since 2003, United States students have shown essentially no growth in test scores in reading, math, and science. (Camera). Even scarier, 30 countries performed better than the US in math, which should arguably be the highest due to the critical thinking skills involved. China, Singapore, Estonia, Canada, Finland, Australia, Japan, U.K., and others all placed above the USA (Hannon). Countries with much lower GDPs and accessible resources are still outperforming us. India graduates more engineers each year than there are engineers that exist in the US (Pai). This further proves that students in America are not being challenged enough. Classes that are more realistic for everyday life should be taught. Off-site locations like Herndon and Summit Technology Academy need to be invested in to get students specialized and excited to go to school. Many graduates have no idea what they want to “do with their life” and have no marketable skills for employers. Students attending university need to major in a field that will be in demand in the coming years. Students would be wasting time if they go into something that will be replaced due to the supply curve shifting. If no skilled workers exist, then they cannot contribute to bettering the US economy and more importantly GDP. In my eyes, if America can breed skilled workers, they can bring more jobs to US soil, causing a massive trickle-down of productivity and positive effects. Trades have been demonized in middle-class America and most graduating students feel as if they have to go to university to feel accomplished when all it does for most is add to the personal and national debt, especially when entering a saturated workforce. If the US took even half of its defense budget of 750 billion~ and funded it into writing a new curriculum, building specialized buildings like STA, and paying teachers more there would be an incentive for students to go to school and for teachers to teach (USASpending). The only reason people can work is because of the education system, so it only makes sense that investing in it makes America productive down the road, yet so many institutions neglect it because it is not instantly profitable. Raising our students better will make them proactive savers, investors, workers, and people as a whole. Re-education programs and proper training could also allow lower-income Americans to re-enter the workforce with efficiency. All in all, education is at the root of a nation's productivity and it would be quite un-intelligent to neglect to evolve it.</p>
        <p>Third off, America needs to grow its jobs on US soil, increase exports so that there is not a trade deficit, and work on recreating a middle class. All of this goes hand in hand with proper education and slowing the inflation of our currency. Skilled workers are worthless if there is nowhere for them to be employed. In America's current state, the BLS says that there are 10 million unemployed people, but the true number is closer to 17 million (BLS and USDebtClock). Most people can get a part-time job somewhere like a restaurant or service business, but this type of employment does not contribute to America's exports. The main exporter for America is food, beverage, and feed at a lowly 133 billion. China for comparison exports more computers, circuits, and apparel than the United States’s top three categories do combine (OEC). China keeps its yuan low so that Americans can consume more of their goods. Americans can be rich because other countries are poor. Now, a drastic switch of making Nikes and computers using American labor would mean that the price doubles or even triples. This is not feasible in the short term, as consumers with habitual spending would find the next best alternative to buying an expensive American-made good because the demand is not there. But, if America were to transition to production jobs over time through a workforce shift, this could be possible and wages would naturally increase with time to where individuals can purchase the American-made goods. America must rely on trade to survive, but if we could even bring our trade deficit to break even with China the effects on the aggregate economy would be astounding. American workers in union jobs with real benefits and a desire to work would be ideal. Aside from 2008, America has been in a decline for net exports since 1980 and has had a deficit at the same time (FREDSTL). With this ideal net even trade deficit in mind, this is possible with a plan. A plan like President Biden's proposed infrastructure plan could lay the groundwork for this transition from disorganized labor into steady and needed jobs on US soil. I believe that the country could benefit from a package similar to what is proposed in the sense of promoting economic growth through investing in the country again by innovating and repairing transportation and infrastructure. Better roads/mass transit will not only make transportation more efficient but supply millions of jobless Americans with consistent pay and work that they want to do. The result is trained individuals ready to continue working in the country. Something like this would also help unify the middle class again, as it would likely be funded by taxing the richest of the rich. Income distribution is very polar and is a complex solution to fix within a capitalistic society, but at a simple level, the government could just tax their income upwards of 50%. The top 1% of Americans own more wealth than the bottom 92% and Over 500 billionaires were made during COVID (Peterson-Whithorn). The only way to benefit from this is by raising income taxes for these individuals. Bringing millions of lower-class Americans to a middle-class status will only do good for the economy and can set a precedent for their kids for generations to come. If these people are well educated and are trained workers then a cycle of debt and poor financial decisions can and will be broken. In addition to income inequality, political polarity is at all-time highs in the last 10 years, and especially in the last year (Drutman). Elections split families apart and different viewpoints on the pandemic, the Black Lives Matter movement, and many other topics cause people to be very opinionated and follow what their respective pack does. I do not believe that society should be this way, as we cannot function effectively without working together. This is why a program that allows the lower/middle class to work together could be very beneficial. I think that Americans demonize viewpoints opposite from theirs and haven't taken time to think for themselves or simply just talk to each other. Positive social interactions with those you do not agree with = a more productive and cooperative world for tomorrow. One looming problem with implementing an infrastructure plan would be the fossil fuels it burns to create. I think that Congress should write up a bill that also includes the creation of new clean energy plants, such as nuclear, hydro, solar, and any other type. If the US neglects to innovate its energy grid, it will inevitably fail and be an economic nightmare to fix. We should take advantage of this now, and create jobs renovating renewable energy solutions. If successful in this, the rest of the world may even buy energy solutions from us, adding to exports. Everything stated above, from creating production jobs in America, taxing the top 1%, and implementing new energy technologies, grow the nation's GDP, and increase exports. Growing GDP leads to decreasing debt over time, assuming the new generation of workers make smart financial decisions and truly invest in their country. If the United States turns itself around in the next 10 years, countries like China will continue to invest in us and potentially even forgive our debt if we can offer them something to benefit them.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, fixing America is a multi-layered complex problem and there is no foolproof way to fix a country spiraling in indebtedness. However, I have hope that with the right tools and reallocation of scarce resources, we can be turned around into the America that our grandparents knew growing up when most had an equal playing field and knew that they were going to turn out alright. In the short term, if the Federal Reserve increases interest rates and stops printing money, we can get back on track to working towards a more balanced society and dampen the effects of inflation. In addition to this, they could set plans in place to transition the US financial system into a digital system to make more educated financial decisions. If successful in terms of fiscal policy, America can overhaul its education by creating smart, specialized workers who understand the world they are living in and are excited to participate in bettering the country, making intelligent financial decisions, and reducing personal debt along the way. Lastly, applying our new flow of specialized workers to an overhauled labor market where jobs are brought back to America and exports are grown will reduce the national debt and increase pride in the country, since workers will be happy to live in the country that they fixed themselves.</p>
