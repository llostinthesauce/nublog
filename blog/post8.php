        <p>To start, we need to determine what it means to agree on something existing. Existence is, “the fact or state of living or having objective reality.” Or under philosophical terms, “the ontological property of being.” With this established, we now know that for something to exist, it must be universally perceived the same way (in the sense of agreeing something exists visually). I would also like to note the difference between acknowledging existence (objectively) and having an opinion on something that exists (subjective). Both can exist and everyone experiences “objective” things in their manner. This leads me to the question of this debate: How can we move from subjective claims of experience to objective claims of “fact”?</p>
        <p>For one’s subjective claim to have any value in contributing to what may become a fact, it needs validity. I would argue that no “fact” can be universally trusted off one person’s account and validity can only be accomplished through multiple accounts of the same conclusion (or at least close enough to the same conclusion). Think about the entire ideology behind group decisions or councils of people deciding what is best for themselves. Often, time groups that hold more accounts overall conclude more accurate things (peer-reviewed science or democratic systems) However, this can also work oppositely, in the sense of Religion or corrupt politics, but eventually breaks down as “wrong” ideas fall out of favor over time (Communism). So, for subjective accounts to be taken as fact, multiple people need to all agree on the definition.</p>
        <p>Humans are notoriously good at being incredibly wrong, and we often change what we agree on as fact. Also, a fact is just something that has enough evidence / where enough people agree on it. It is also important that humans challenge facts to ensure their validity through time (Scientific Method). Only after evidence is provided, in the forms of experiments, experience, and multiple accounts we can then conclude objective fact. And even after this, we need to remain skeptical of our findings. I would argue that humans cannot evolve forward without the right amount of skepticism about what we agree on as the truth. What I experience about something determined as “fact” will undoubtedly be different than the next guys. And it will especially be different when compared to someone that has more knowledge about a subject than I do. Therefore, we must take multiple experiences into account when determining truth.</p>
        <p>This begs the question: Does anyone individual experience things the same way as anyone else? I would say that the answer is yes and no. The answer is yes because as stated earlier if something exists then it is perceived the same way objectively (visually and the fact that it is in the physical realm). But beyond initial perception, the answer of yes breaks down because everyone will have their own opinion on said item. Subjectiveness takes over and deviation for the previously agreed upon truth is slightly broken. The consensus will likely stay the same, but humans will always differ slightly. And if everyone perceived it in the same way forever, then there couldn’t have been skepticism in the first place to create/test new truths. So, to conclude, “Fact” can only be determined from a multitude of various accounts (subjectively) of an objective instance to cover any ground. Once something is agreed upon, it should frequently be tested or challenged, to ensure validity and agreement between most. It is almost impossible for everyone to agree but with checks and balances, we can get close.</p>
