        <h2>preface-preface::</h2>
        <p>i am in no way entitled to intelligently write on these matters. this is simply a collection of some of my observations. i am not the best writer, and i did not check for grammar.</p>
        <h3>religion as a preface</h3>
        <p>ive been thinking a bit about religion. My belief is that “God”, rooted in Abrahamic religions of the world, is mostly a construct of humanity to answer the questions/wonders/control people. This is nothing new, but I have thought this since age 14 or so. However, all religions share the same common ends, that being, the belief in a god and/or multiple gods that transcend this place and time. Omnipresent. Are we innately programmed to be god fearing and seeking? Humanity evolved in a time where our brains grew more complex than we could begin to understand, and naturally we looked for patterns and sought an explanation. Alas, religion is born. I get caught up on the fact that many intelligent people die on the hill of religion. Pascals wager? Immense hardship that points people to acceptance? Fear of death? As much as I have tried, I just cant see through this facade. However, “God” to me just means the energy/force of the universe and outer space. This may seem ambivalent, but it is natural and observable. There is a intrinsic balance in this world, and purely everything can be boiled down to energy transfer. No person with will created this, we are merely a byproduct of it, and some say that humans only exist to speed up the heat death of the universe. Life may not have even began on Earth after all, we skipped a couple billion years in evolutionary complexity for seemingly no reason at all. I wonder how long into humanities future it will take for people to see this as fact, probably forever. Modern religion exists as an oppressor, and more people break free as time marches on. The information age and the onset of the Internet and global trade has sped up and perpetuated this freedom. On the other hand, humans have only lived this complex of lives for 1% of our existance. Trouble grappling with the modern world? God explains that. Some countries and cultures know this, see China and some Nordic countries. They realized that a population base that is rooted in religious values is only hindering personal well-being and focus. America on the other hand, has a long way to go, and it may cease to exist in a familiar way before most* people share this belief. I am not calling for people to change, but it is merely an observation. Dividedness does us no good. But alas…</p>
        <h4>looking around</h4>
        <p>Politicians and power figures share many common denominators. Many of these people in the modern day have learned that they can take advantage of the most people by prescribing to what the average person wants to hear, and makes followers feel like they are on their side. I don’t exactly blame these people, from the onset of World Trade, to the Industrial Revolution, to now the Information Age, there was no set path and many just did as they saw fit to survive. However, there are theoretical limits within this, and many modern figures are jogging the line. Nobody can really be an “ethical billionaire” or politician. There is a natural push/pull to achieve this amount of success and someone has to be taken advantage of. Society has unwillingly let the “wrong” groups of people get into power positions, and we have made it easier for them to stay in power. This has only gotten easier as technology has marched on and attitudes have gotten more complex. Previously, if there was a mass class/power disparity between the citizens and those at the top, the people became very angry and did something about it. See the French Revolution, or notabaly any of them throughout history. I think it is likely a common thing that commoners in society worship politicians, CEOs, and celebrities as gods. Stop and think for a second as to why these people should care about you? Of course there are outliers, but I think it is safe to say that generally when one harnesses such power and money, they look down on those that let them get to that point. And even if it is half of the people that share this stance, that is more than enough to keep perpetuating it. I would argue that most are using commoners as means to larger predatory ends, thats just capitalism or politics folks. All industries, not just high value S&P companies or the government are pointing toward this. The entertainment industry, education, tech, general commerce… the list goes on.         </p>
        <h5>Entertainment, Sports, Politics, Companies, Pharmaceuticals, and more…</h5>
        <p>Musicians and actors are worshipped as gods, and there is an endless feed of media surrounding them. Slop for people to become enamored by and create parasocial relationships so that the wheel keeps turning. Fanbases are conditions to devote every last dollar to literal billionaires. And they happily do it… why? Notably the NFL in America reeks of this too, being poised as a tax-shelter and keeping devoted people on the edge of their seats. Oh boy! And now Taylor Swift is involved! It is a perfect publicity storm. Ive seen every last business do what they can to cash in on this, and it horrifies me. Was it always this way, or do people have nothing else to grab onto? It is easier to follow and consume given these modern coniditons than it is to step back, observe, and create. This scares me, because I don’t know if I have faith in people to do better for themselves, it’s sort of a hive-mind. Think about the last few Netflix movies you have seen, were they any good? Or were they just entertaining enough to keep you on the site? Think TikTok shop, Instagram ads in every other post, industry plants in the music industry, trends, and the commodification of all. AI will perpetuate this, it is only the beginning. People will happily watch an AI generated movie, tailored to their needs and will not see a problem with it. Journalism, authentic writing, and opportunity will likely die. AI and the eventual AGI is a net-positive, but not for some people, depending on how you view positive. Furthermore, we have seen businessmen and ex-movie stars become prominent political figures, with seemingly endless people to back them up, sigh. Politicians prey on Americans “patriotism” or their idea of what this country was or could be. Corruption is likely rampant, insider trading, and so on. Many “great”American companies lack the innovation they once had, and have turned to re-iterating, outsourcing labor, and have prioritized a faster turnover on product to increase their bottom line. Amazon anymore is just Alibaba with lipstick on the pig. Consumers have little options for quality anymore, and it is harder than ever to find quality. Quality is not the baseline, good enough is, with an emphasis on replaceable and repeat customers. Why are there so many subscription services now… what? There is a close connection between the entertainment industry and brand identity. Everyone and everything is a walking ad. Celebrities flash absurd brands to flex their status or because they are paid to, and their followers gobble up anything close to it. People that do not have the money for luxury brands see it as a stamp of success if they can obtain that item or thing too. All while the execs get rich. Sigh. I have less trust in the medical industry as a whole than I used to, maybe when one learns about how other countries approach it, it can feel a bit enlightening. I don’t think there is a non-zero chance that treatment plans for chronic illnesses have been designed to keep people patients for longer, supplying them with more drugs and repeat visits because it nets everyone along the line with more dollars in their pockets at the end of the day. Most people in this as individuals become doctors or nurses or specialists because they want to help people, and it pays well, yet they are being taken advantage of too. The goal of the corporations behind all of it is to generate money, not to save lives. If they can save some, thats better than none, but keeping people entangled is likely the business model. If you are treated and healed, then there is no more money to be earned. The agri-food organizations of America too are no different. Food quality has increasingly grown worse and chronic illnesses tied to this consumtion has grown as well. Many companies have lobbied and have seats on the boards of the USDA that make the decisions as to what is a “healthy” diet or what the “right” foods to eat are. Companies can earn more on their bottom line if they produce cheaper, longer lasting, and more tasty food items. See the middle of any grocery store. We are eating more inhumane food than ever, and it shows. More than half of all Americans are obsese and don’t see a problem with these foods, but at some point you can’t even blame them. When you have limited money and the only option is hyper-processed junk, what else are you supposed to do? It saddens me greatly that this has become the norm, at the hands of the conglomerate food corporations that allowed this to happen, whether intentional or not, it is profitable, and until there is a large public outcry or concern, nothing will change. Many people become long-term patients because of the food they have consumed their whole lives, and that is profitable too. Sigh. In a way, for-profit Univerities are the same. The cost to attend college has 10xed since my parents went to school… what? Obviously inflation is a factor, but even adjusted for inflation, the costs are abusrd. This has simply happened because those in charge of the numbers realized that middle/upper class Americans will keep sending their children in droves to “good” because it worked for them so it must work for their kids. Anyone with sense in the modern day would know that only a few degrees are actually worth their monetary (and time) investment. Growing up in middle-americas suburbia, I was always told that college is kind of the only option to be successful, and eyeing trades or labor was frowned upon. “Use your head, not your hands” is something I heard. I am not anti-college or education, but I would argue, that in 2024, most kids do not need or will really benefit from college. The most popular degrees are in humanaties, and quite frankly, kind of pointless. These only really hurt the individual, as the jobs end up being lacking and are just not worth the information gained/time lost, just to pay someone else off. If you are happy to pay 100k to learn about what is free online, then more power to you. As for those that can get degrees for cheap or free, then sure, it’s better than the other alternatives for most people. I see many students at SEC schools going to get the most general business degree they can obtain, relying on ChatGPT to complete their work, and charge up their parents credit cards at the bars every weekend. This is insane to me, these people will graduate, and (maybe?) get a low-productivity desk job, and reminisce on the “good old days” back in college. This is insane to me. These are the people that are well off and will be okay because of their folks money. This is not the case for many. Even if your parents didn't have the money to send you to school debt-free, many kids still choose this because it is what they were told will work or just because thats what most* people do. These people are the ones that rack up the most debt, oftentimes to the sound of hundreds of thousands, and they are happily okay with it. 100k in debt for a general business degree. Oh boy!!! Schools intentionally do not teach kids or even adults about personal finance and the general tasks of budgeting or just monetary policy, because it is not profitable to do so. Banks and credit card companies and lending agencies would not have a business model if everyone paid on time. Lawyers and accountants and the tax code all share the same thing. They use convultued jargon to confuse people so that you just hire someone who is trained in it to give them a job. These topics do not have to be this complex! We have only made them so complex so that extortion can be applied. Oh, leave it to the pros! I get specialization, but seriously most of these matters are not that complex! When people don’t understand something (or arent easily given the resources to) they naturally are taken advantage of, resulting in someone else benefiting off of their ignorance. This is the theme of all of these topics. Does anyone ask why?</p>
        <h6>to conclude...</h6>
        <p>All of this to say, that the modern world, and specifically America in 2024 is at a critical point. We are more divided than ever, with morals, power dynamics, beliefs, money/wealth gap, class, opportunity, and so much more. This place is not the same as it was when my parents grew up, or even their parents, and perhaps all of America was built on these shaky foundations, we are just in the critical exponiental stages of it. Hyperinflation looms, politics seem doomed, and people are unhappy. Most empires eventually fall, but that was pre-everything modern, so who knows what America will do to save itself. There are many red flags, people protesting, people taking action on their own volition, outright denial, and general unease is growing more common. Everyone in some way is being taken advantage of, maybe that is just society. Corruption is rampant, and human nature doesn’t really allow for everyone to be corgile. Those in power are quite good at hiding it, but there are cracks. Greed and a thirst for power is a tale as old as time. We can make it out of these scary times, but I am afraid that people are more distracted than ever to actually listen to each other and to try for a change. Staying stubborn and closeted only leads to resentment and hate and violence. Most people are happy enough with their creature comforts and would rather keep scrolling and eating ummy yummy sugar than think about why/how we got here and how we can fix it. Junk food and cheap/slop entertainment is more accessible than ever, and it takes self control to not fall into this dopamine trap. AI accelerates this. Humans thrive on community, creativity, and novelty. Those who do “pay attention” can easily get pipelined into following the politicians or some weird extremist groups because they think they care about them and find community there. These people are clapping for the wrong reasons. Keeping people busy/entertained or give them spaces to ask the wrong questions is a great way to stay in power and keep moving pieces around behind the scenes. Rich people and political figures do NOT care about us. I wish I could say that I had faith in the common people, but with the way things look currently, I sadly do not have much. We can do better for ourselves. But, this point in history is likely a necessary step in the evolution of what will become of us. With AGI on the horizon, it will be an interesting ride. Who knows if I will find a job. Hug your friends, write down your thoughts, exist in nature.</p>
