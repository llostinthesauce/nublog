        <p>the most idiotic most commonly held belief of young people’s today (gen z and millennials) are that our parents or grandparents lived in the true “glory days” or “golden years”  and that activities or places aren’t the same as they used to be, when in reality they likely thought the same things in their time. our daily truth is truly what we make it to be. while it may be harder than ever to find this fulfillment or enjoyment, it is possible. the internet has made all world culture and pop-culture into an grandiose amalgamation of all and platforms “core”-ify everything from the 70s to mid 2010s already. time is a flat circle and no emotion or event is truly unique in that they repeat time and time again, just in different forms.</p>
        <p>and at least in the west, many people spend hours every day online wishing they were living as someone else or in a different year or country. nobody is happy with their now anymore and turn to dopamine slot machines for their daily fix. we aren’t social and the general youth are becoming less sociable as time goes on because of this. will we reach a breaking point and tip the other way? history says yes. while the internet was unprecedented, it has fundamentally changed every single aspect of our day to day lives and i believe some sort of single use simplified balance must be found for humans to not crumble.</p>
        <p>suicide and overdose are almost at all time highs and there seems to be no sign of stopping. so many consume without thought and can’t bare being bored for longer than a few moments. this is so true to the point where it seems weird to not be on your phone in a public setting or if you meditate you seem weird to most. people don’t walk, cook, create, or wonder anymore.</p>
        <p>the world may not be so simple anymore, and economic outlook has been much better, returning to the roots that make us human and social will continue to grow and come back around to those that were deprived of it</p>
        <p>it’s shocking that little things that once seemed so trivial or necessary are seen as life hacks or self help tips now. actions such as simple exercise, clearing your mind, chatting with an old friend, staring at the sky, cooking a meal for your family, seeing new places, and walking all make us feel whole, yet many don’t participate. no wonder “we” feel like shit all of the time</p>
        <p>alas, i have hope because we have always pulled through, even when the outlook was bleak. time is unforgiving. would you rather remember the hope you had and the power to push through to enjoy or the bitterness of wishing you were anywhere else when you’re 80?</p>
