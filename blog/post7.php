        <p>The best proof for the existence of God would be to observe the arguments of Pantheism. Pantheism essentially states that the higher power of the universe encompasses all aspects of anything in the universe. This means that every living (or dead) person, thing, law, object, and idea is itself a part of the universe, and therefore is “god.” Typical religions in the modern-day (and historically) have often clashed with each other over ideas, origin stories, and land. Pantheism ignores all of this because it is not focused on a specific prophet or sacred text that was passed down through generations to prove its validity. Abrahamic religions all have their legend for how their history went down, and study slightly different texts that cause them to clash as a result. In addition to this, I would argue that Pantheism is also the most logical (or likely) religion for the sake of science.</p>
        <p>Within Pantheism, the God themselves in question is essentially the mash of all things in existence, meaning that anything is living proof. Since the proof for a God within Pantheism is so broad, one needs to consider the reasons why Pantheism is superior to the next religion. As stated above, typical religion often idolizes either a singular god/figure or a few. Almost all religions have some sort of sacred text and following as well. Typical religions also often provide a view of the afterlife for those that abide by the rules of the texts. In my opinion, humans were not put on Earth to pray to a God that we likely made up. In ancient times, most people likely did not know better and followed the word of the church because they were scared to do otherwise. Religion often corrupts governments and can hold science back to a point where humans are evolving backward. Another flaw with typical religions is that there are so many different ones that swear they are the one true religion. Pantheism also bypasses this because there is no central say, rule, or law that says what people must do or believe in. I see Pantheism as almost a negative religion in the sense that it doesn’t care about the typical intricacies of modern religion. If true, Pantheism includes all religions as well and doesn’t even try to invalidate them. If someone else’s validation is a part of another religion, then it is still a part of Pantheism and the universe.</p>
        <p>Pantheism could be compared to Atheism in the sense that there is no humanoid God to follow, but I would say that Atheists believe in nothing at all, especially not believing in the chance for some higher power to exist in the first place. Some may be turned away by Pantheism because there is no historical text or central figure or even a large following, but this is what makes it different. And if I had to pick a religion to follow, it would be Pantheism. Pantheism is logical for the pure fact that nothing science perceives as true challenges its definition. The Pantheist takes the world for what it is and embraces all aspects of it as a part of the whole that is their God. Pantheism does not break the laws of physics or actively try to invalidate others’ views. Pantheism is a step back that almost looks at all religions and takes any action as evidence for its existence.</p>
