        <p>Coming from an information technology major in 2025, I can safely say that… The more I get into tech, the more I kinda hate it. I would say that I have a healthier relationship with it as of late, that is 90% of the time. Everyone in gen z has those dark days… Most of the time, I use it to extract data from online channels, and the remaining 10% is just entertainment (in the form of youtube). There is a a very negative correlation between my algorithm/dopamine-driven social media use, and my deep dive into being a CS and IT major. I am genuinely turned off by most modern implementations of tech, aside from LLMs and agent-related apps or my own personal web 2 sites or projects. These tools (LLMs) are godsends, and for the top 10% who use them, increasingly allow value to be extracted and for workflows to be leveraged and perpetuated. Even this very website you may be reading this on, was co-developed with none other than ChatGPT! (full distinction, I can implement a simple .html web server without the help of AI, but sometimes the mundane tasks only take time away…) With this, they have an ever-growing capacity to make the majority lazier. That is, for those humans that  don’t yet know how to use to their advantage yet, namely those that fail to understand them. Being me, I note that the top free productivity apps on the apple app store have been GPT rollups for some time now, and they are rollups that make the interfaces easier to use. Whether that is a homework buddy, a sexbot, or a plant identifier. These have been stripped to serve the masses, because many are confused by the interface that is a LLM chat prompt. They do not know how to extract value from this. Why do people need their hands held to use something like ChatGPT? And, to add some sugar on the rim, these rollups are paid—what the fuck? I can assume that trend will continue, and these tools will just be ever-growlingly integrated into the internet forever. Sadly, the place I was born in no longer exists. Gone are the days of simple HTML or .php sites (like this one!!!!), honest and simple APIs, or a diversified and personalized internet. Honestly Mark Zuckerberg is partially to blame, as he popularized web 2.0, making the common people of the world able to proceed and post content at the swipe of a finger…</p>
        <p>To sort of reference Dune, in this near-distant future, they banned AI because the masses got taken advantage of at scale, and no one could think freely anymore. Full distinction, this was largely due to the bots enslaving the humans, but in a way we are already there. Leveraging AI for productivity and information extraction is NOT the same as using it in place of critically thinking. I am not saying that this will happen, but so many people will now truly never pick up a book, read documentation, or do a little work on their own. Sure, learning is leveraged and more accessible, but we have fewer experts in specific things, and this is where pure innovation arises. With the onset of these models, the current state of the internet, speed of information, and learning as a whole, I’ve never been more attracted to reading dense books and writings made by experts in fields. And specifically ones that weren’t developed alongside AI. There will likely be mass information available in 3-5 years that compiles knowledge into the experts, and they will make great literature as a result, but this is not here yet. At least before, we had aggregate pages like wikis for high-level knowledge, but AI flattens all of this. It’s a tradeoff; everyone knows more and how to do more, but creativity and critical thinking (for average people?) on deep subjects are rejected. I’ve found myself becoming this way sometimes, especially on topics in school I don’t find worthy of my time. Post-graduation, I’ll leverage AI on topics I don’t care about and read the true sources for everything critical. This also applies to literature and general reading. Our society is not well-read anymore, and niches are increasingly separating us. Being a child on the internet from 2010-2020, memes and general internet culture were unified. This is not true anymore—algorithms have ruined it. See election results, see social interaction, see dating struggles in Gen Z, see consumer choices… Being a passive consumer is the worst thing you can do as a young person right now. Or even an old person. Or any person. Netflix is not your friend, the sponsored algorithm ads are not your friend, discover weekly is not your friend, the Amazon homepage is not your friend. The average person does so little to actively choose what they consume (food, media, reading, etc.). When we get used to passively consuming, we all grow increasingly agreeable, and the bar for slop/entertainment is so goddamn low. This even applies to discussions in class… Nobody wants to have deep thoughts on even minisclue topics relevant to the class, because of this mindset and the attention grabber that is the mobile device. I grit my teeth at the fact that it’s replaced so much casual time, thought, and social interaction. We are kinda cooked, and this transcends generations. My parents are cooked too. I don’t want to be cynical, but we are in the early to middle stages of mobile devices being a social normality, and there is definitely a large pushback coming. You can even see the seeds of it on the right spaces on X or in certain social circles. I yearn for a pre or post-mobile device life, but I can’t do anything to change it. However, given this immovable object, I can be a mindful consumer and participant. I can use physical media, or talk to friends for recommendations on places to eat or to travel. I won’t download your “app,” but I will sit outside, wonder a bit (around in 3D space, and in my mind), pick a random location, and talk to many strangers. Don’t let the “algorithm” dictate your decisions/life. </p>
        <p>Also, consider this an ode to what will be lost: the old internet, indie productions, universal experiences, mom and pop shops, movie theaters, un-commodified places, writing, freedom(?), small towns, maps, newspapers, placards, design, and much, much more. To hold on a little longer (or apply some agency…?) use old iPods, digital cameras, physical media, standalone devices, pen and paper… and so on. It fucking sucks that every app has a subscription or algorithm to serve you endless feeds. What happened to devices/sites just doing their job and that being it? Sigh. I very much barbell my tech and internet use. As I said in the beginning, this is my speciality. I am an IT/CS major, and my hobby has been tech for as long as I can remember. I know more than I ever have, right now, yet I resent technology more than ever. To wrap this, I call upon my reader to be mindful. I am so very into OS, hardware, crypto, AI, and web dev, but I also hate so much modern tech (moreso the web 2.0 derivative algos and apps and commodification of all things) and I often reject it to spend time IRL. Especially in summertime. I pray many others find this balance. Delete your Instagram, be free. Do not engage in things that do not serve you. And for the people that say it is innocent entertainment, I would ask them to consider their standard of such topics.</p>
        <p>To extend on this a bit, I am the most motivated, happy, fulfilled, and driven when I am learning new topics, or teaching them to others. I have had the great fortune to be a broadcast engineer at a student radio station and it brings be great joy to help others out in this regard. I can identify that I have a little demon in me when the intellectual flow of a project or concept really drives me, and all other things become secondary. I honestly love this about myself. I just need the right combination of forces at play to keep me on a track of fulfillment and success, all while hopefully becoming a more educated, traveled, and nuanced person each and every day. Change is nonlinear, and I am so young! Everything isn’t so serious, yet knowledge drives me. Genuinely, the only times I feel the worst are when I perceive myself as unintelligent, incompetent, or incapable. Objective truths can tell me otherwise, but that is the trade-off for what drives me. A challenge to my “knowledge” or skill/ability hurts real bad. I also can completely admit that this is a weird hill to die on. What good does it do to know just… things? Someone else would say, “What’s it all for man? You can’t know everything.” However, that isn’t the point. I truly believe that there is no downside to learning. One can apply this lens to all aspects of life, all experiences. Traveling or taking the long way home or participating in something (worthy) that is way out of my usual lane—this fuels me, as it is classified under knowledge. This is why I happily talk to strangers; I often enjoy it more than my own friends. EXP = life.</p>
        <p>I’ve sort of gamified living (thank you, [maybe] OCD)—a blessing and a curse, but even if something is illogical, or wastes time, or seems secondary to important matters, I can still deem it as valuable because it is EXP. Sure, I’ll go to the “XYZ out-of-my-lane” activity because of the potential EXP. Lastly, through this, I find that I can understand all human experience better. Everyone has their own grasp on this, and my world(view) isn’t your world(view), and that is okay! But! The caveat is that the more you interact with it, the more you get out of it. This is a tale as true as time. Gen Z needs to have some agency, ffs!</p>
