        <p>sort of setting up this as a different place to put some things. the main blogpost page on here is really for longer form thoughts and such and i sort of want a place to just "tweet" or whatever. so a subfolder of /daily should be good. i also will try and make a new post daily. the objective is to make it one month and see if i can conclude anything. derp fr.</p>
        <p>i beat the washington post crossword in 30 minutes and the wordle in 8 seconds. these puzzles can likely expand some useless part of my brain but i quite enjoy them right now</p>
        <p>sort of trying to understand how i feel now about i suppose "personall growth" and what that means. this is of course a personal jourey and it is hard to confirm oneself in how they feel. as in genuienly what one person feels about themselves. many seek this confirmation or purpose from other people or trusted people but it could be seen as false? i dont really know. the right answer is probably a mix of how one feels about themself + how their family or others close percieve them. I guess it is difficult to shift all of that energy to self when many people can be a bit selfless or selfish in unhealthy ways. i guess there is no guidebook on how someone is supposed to feel good in their own skin/self and this is why people easily can get misguided, esp if they dont have many super close people and just let things (perception of self) fester and it can feel wrong or strange. i feel better when i am around other humans, even being introverted. we all need social interaction n stuffs </p>
        <p>i guess i am trying to understand what it FEELS like to know that I have made substantial change or growth in a certain department. i can think black and white sometimes but very personal/emotional challenges are not like math problems or objective truths. only i have my head and myself and i have to measure for myself what that feels like. a lot of people have substance but it may be misplaced perhaps. i think i fall to this sometimes, and i am trying not to silence my interests and channels of expression and how i spend time. i have unhealthily imposed lots of duties onto myself to where i become very stressed. this is not how i want to live life, so i wont do it anymore! even if it means sacrificing (spell check) and rebuilding. </p>
        <p>i also think that true fulfilment in life probably only can come after one feels solid about themself. this means being alone and not NEEDING someone else or some large distraction to exist. not everyone has to be perfect, and there is a big distinction between bad / trying / better / great / perfect. nobody can achieve perfect, but if someones attitude reflects trying or better then they can healthily engage in many areas of life. if someone is in the lower tier (bad) then many things will just cause suffering. maybe? </p>
        <p>nobody is ever going to pull anyone out of a mental mess that can only be solved within. via reflection and adapting and actively changing to work toward something. </p>
        <p>the point of these feelings is to be kind to myself and to be patient to myself. for most of my life, i have felt urgency to act and a duty to continue forward even if i am unhappy currently. this is not great, because i tire myself out and have to rebuild harder. So! the attitude here is that i MUST keep doing what I want to do. this is very general, but i dont have to attend self help classes or make such strict rules for my life. this is hard for me. to just flow on with time and see where my energy goes. this leaves me hurting in a few specific areas that have meant a lot to me, but is nessecary to my overall being to march on. i perhaps can even return to things that were hurting me (not directly, but because of my framing) some day if i can change how i think about it or prove to myself that i am in the place for it. alas. i not must put so much pressure on myself. i am at my own pace now, and i must put me first to be better for everyone else (AND MYSELF!). it is funny, i find myself being kinder to all when i adopt this attitude. thinking more about my relationships and friends in life and having a balance with them leaves me feeling overall happier, more gratuitious, and motivated. go figure. crazy that making my entire life about one thing is not the right approach. but i live and i learn. also, there is never an end goal in stability or personal growth or self actualization or whatever you wanna call it. i beleive this marches on until the day i die. if i become stubborn and stagnant and complacent in some areas, this infects other areas, then i become a bitter old man. i will NOT be this. anyways the minecraft movie was not good. </p>
