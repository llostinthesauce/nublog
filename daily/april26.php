        <p>pictured are my leftovers from dinner. just a ground beef blob salted with some... salt</p>
        <p>i watched django unchained (re) with mackenzie. lovely movie and has some sequences that are unbeatable. some of it has aged interestingly tho.</p>
        <p>i write this at 1:39 am as i spin some albums. i am trying to maxamize albums played per the time i have here. i used to only put an album on front to back but i am of the opinion now that i need to get my moneies worth so i have been playing a side or so then switching. i am probably conditioned this way after vinylthon at kcou. there i played no more than two tracks from one side of an lp then moved on to the next. yee</p>
        <p>i have only a few final projects left for my classes then i am done. summer is basically here. this is likely my last summer break, maybe ever? as a college student and regular student i have grown quite used to summer and winter breaks. i will likely miss these, as in the real "world" there is no such thing. still working on getting an internship. alas. </p>
        <p>i have nothing to say</p>
