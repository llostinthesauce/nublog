        <p>i suppose i jumped the gun on forcing myself to make a daily upload everday here, but the main idea still stands. i will use these as a public digital journal or short form posts. i don't have to do it everyday tho because sometimes i really don't have anything! let it come naturally.</p>
        <p>today, i watered my plants. i also submitted my last two projects for the semester, and had meetings with my groups for the projects. I will finish with all As, and the intership search is still propspective. just a few days left in this collge town and i will transition my home base. i am quite excited to get back to my trails and cooking and building out a daily routine. internship permitting, this will look different too. </p>
        <p>i feel refreshed and calm. one semester left and my true "adult" life will begin. or maybe that is a bad way to think about it? unsure. I do know what i need and want moving forward, and it feels great to have direction. i think perhaps my direction was not very clear and i have much to think about it. returning to self is always rewarding and a very personal journey. this is exciting! </p>
        <p>summer plans: internship...? practice being mindful and kind to myself. explore my interests and continue working on projects, especially for github and so on. reading too, i have many books that are collecting dust. i have some new friends back home that i will definitely spend time with. this will be good! and family. very important. i also want to do more physical projects, like building something or just using my hands. my walking stamina is great, and i can probably practice trail running or more proper hiking again. i always feel great when i do this. however! i will not hold myself to all of these high standards, or i will just be dissapointed or burnt out. this is important, and something i have learned about myself. the bar i set does not have to be so high that i get stressed out by more casual interests or tasks. I just want to have some ideas, and will see where the time takes me. </p>
        <p>all in all, i feel good about where things are at. focus ebbs and flows as life tasks ebb and flow. I have lived enough to know what i default to, and when i dont like what that default is, i can change it! this is my attitude. life gives back as much as you give it. i am driven and quite motivated and am happy to explore this positively. attitude is everything, as well as being realistic. i think as a child i always set the bar very high for myself so it has been easy to get down on myself especially when things change. The key here is to feel and reflect and act. not just one or two of those, but all. or something like that. words are not reflective fully of feelings or plans. actions are too and many things don't need to be methodically figured out or explained. this is good! </p>
        <p>every new season of life offers many lessons from the last, and some of these take plenty time to actually be realized. this is also neat! change and personal growth is not linear and this is an intentional aspect of our lives. to be human is to learn from mistakes and make a stand about these mistakes. being real and honest with yourself and those close to you has a profound compounding positive effect. also to forgive others, and to forgive onself. some are better at this than others, and this is okay too! life isn't just a program or assignment that is completed and left behind. every action has an equal and oppositte reaction. and much of this can't be explained or fully figured out. some things just are! this is the beauty to it! let there be some mystery in life, a little superstition or belief goes a long way. it is a part of how we think for a reason. we are not computers. that is the irony of my major, everything is logical and methodological and this is NOT how life works lol. i have to remind myself that sometimes</p>
        <p>our brains ruminate on items from the past or future or present, and for good reason. this is our bodies telling us something. this goes back to what can't really be described, but there is some life essence there. some things or feelings transcend logic and time and space. and that is good! </p>
        <p>to close, i am very excited about the future and i am happy to be alive. everything that has happened, has for a reason, and this will continue to be the case. lifes mysteries will keep unfolding and i am joyed to see where that will take me. </p>
