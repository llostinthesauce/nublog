        <h1>about [REDACTED] & this site</h1>
        <p>nuBlog is the home of legendary X dot com user, <a href="https://x.com/badc0vers" target="_blank">[REDACTED]</a>'s musings and other things of the sort...</p>

        <p>i happen to be a fourth-year uni student studying IT and CS. i am also the broadcast engineer of my school's radio station, located somewhere in the US... and i have a weekly show there on tuesday @ 8pm. i like music and of course movies, and i would classiy myself as an avid media enjoyer. conversely, i have been trying to get more into books, and have amassed a large collection. perhaps someday i may write his own... more recently, i have become an iPod hobbyist, and created this site!</p>

        <p>i quite like old physical tech, which includes but is not limited to: iPods, digital cameras, film cameras, old smartphones, desktop computers, home stereos, game consoles, and radio broadcast equipment. aside from all of that, i walk this earth religiously, i think i cook fairly (need to be better @ this), i am data/knowledge-driven, and i have a decent (vested) interest in the crypto/finance sphere. i am quite into reading/tech/ai/&so-on and i engage quite heavily in this discourse online and in person when possible. i am proficient in C, C++, Python, Swift, SQL~, Bash scripting, (HTML/CSS/JS), and other languages.</p>

        <p>the hope here is to post some longer-form writing, shorter-form daily entries, pictures, projects, and whatever else. modern social media has become lifeless and i do not find joy in posting anywhere, so i created this site. AND! there is some essence to putting thoughts into the air. i am well aware that this is for me more than anyone else, so please let me know if you found anything interesting! this is also a little project, as i am self-hosting this on an old pi, using nginx, and a gui-less pios installation. enjoy! (bonus pts if u know this font =3)</p>
