        <h1>about coby & this site</h1>
        <p>nuBlog is the home of legendary X dot com user, <a href="https://x.com/badc0vers" target="_blank">badc0vers</a>'s musings and other things of the sort... this so-called, "badc0vers" goes by a few names... coby, wayne, conrad, leon, llostinthesauce, and others!</p>

        <p>coby happens to be a fourth-year uni student studying IT and CS. he is also the broadcast engineer of his school's radio station, <a href="https://kcou.fm" target="_blank">kcou.fm</a> and has a weekly show there on tuesday @ 8pm. coby likes <a href="https://music.apple.com/profile/cobyshanks" target="_blank">music</a> and of course <a href="https://letterboxd.com/llostinthesauce/" target="_blank">movies</a> and is an avid media enjoyer. he has been trying to get into <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/158053435-corbin-shanks" target="_blank">books</a> more, amassing a large collection. perhaps someday he may write his own... he has recently become an iPod hobbyist, but let's be real, the seeds were always sown.</p>

        <p>he really likes old physical tech, which includes but is not limited to: iPods, digital cameras, film cameras, old smartphones, desktop computers, home stereos, game consoles, and radio broadcast equipment. aside from all of that, he walks religiously, cooks fairly, is data/knowledge-driven, and has a decent interest in the crypto and finance sphere. he is quite into reading/using artificial intelligence and engages quite heavily in the tech discourse on X and in person when possible. he is proficient in C, C++, Python, Swift, SQL~, Bash scripting, (HTML/CSS/JS), and other languages. "i jailbroke my first iPhone when i was 9 years old." -- okay, enough, NEXT!</p>

        <p>the hope here is to post some longer-form writing. sometimes ranting on the tl is not enough, and there is something about putting some thoughts or words into the air. i am well aware that this is more for me than anyone else, so please do not feel special reading anything. this is also a little project, as i am self-hosting this on an old pi, using nginx, and a gui-less pios installation. enjoy! (bonus pts if u know this font =3)</p>
