        <h1>about [REDACTED] & this site</h1>
        <p>nuBlog is the home of legendary X dot com user, <a href="https://x.com/badc0vers" target="_blank">[REDACTED]</a>'s musings and other things of the sort... this so-called, "[REDACTED]" goes by a few names... [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and others!</p>

        <p>i happen to be a fourth-year uni student studying IT and CS. i am also the broadcast engineer of my school's radio station, located somewhere in the US... and i have a weekly show there on tuesday @ 8pm. i like music and of course movies, and i would classiy myself as an avid media enjoyer. conversely, i have been trying to get more into books, and have amassed a large collection. perhaps someday i may write his own... more recently, i have become an iPod hobbyist, and created this site!</p>

        <p>i quite like old physical tech, which includes but is not limited to: iPods, digital cameras, film cameras, old smartphones, desktop computers, home stereos, game consoles, and radio broadcast equipment. aside from all of that, i walk this earth religiously, i think i cook fairly, i am data/knowledge-driven, and i have a decent (vested) interest in the crypto/finance sphere. i am quite into reading/using artificial intelligence and i engage quite heavily in the tech discourse on X (tpot/postrat/lesswrong) and in person when possible. i am proficient in C, C++, Python, Swift, SQL~, Bash scripting, (HTML/CSS/JS), and other languages. "i jailbroke my first iPhone when i was 9 years old." -- okay, enough, NEXT!</p>

        <p>the hope here is to post some longer-form writing. sometimes ranting on the tl is not enough, and there is something about putting some thoughts or words into the air. i am well aware that this is more for me than anyone else, so please do not feel special reading anything. this is also a little project, as i am self-hosting this on an old pi, using nginx, and a gui-less pios installation. enjoy! (bonus pts if u know this font =3)</p>

        <p>you can find me on X/formerly twitter, (again) at <a href="https://x.com/badc0vers" target="_blank">[REDACTED]</a></p>
        <p>or try to find me on youtube, letterboxd, goodreads, or the wca (world cube association)...
